###Logistic regression

#####without regularization : 

-For un regularized logistic regression, the task was to determine 
  if a student would be admitted into a college given two scores from
  two seperate tests.
-The combination of the two is used to determine the probability the student is admitted.

#####Regularized logistic regression : 

-Given test data from previous chips manufactured by an electronics company, the goal 
   was to determine whether or not chips produced by the same process in this company 
   would pass a test.
   
- The data could not produce a linear decision boundary hence the need to regularize the 
    model and avoid overfitting issues.
